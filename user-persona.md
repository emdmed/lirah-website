# Lirah User Persona

## Primary Persona: The Context-Frustrated Developer

### Demographics
- Professional software developer (mid to senior level)
- Works with medium to large codebases (10K-100K+ lines)
- Uses AI coding assistants daily (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot)
- Tech stack: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, or similar

### Pain Points

**The Context Problem:**
- Spends significant time deciding which files to share with Claude
- Frequently hits context limits when trying to give Claude enough information
- Gets frustrated when Claude doesn't know about relevant parts of their codebase
- Has to re-explain project structure repeatedly across conversations

**Current Workarounds:**
- Manually copies and pastes multiple files into prompts
- Tries to summarize architecture in prose (time-consuming, incomplete)
- Accepts suboptimal AI responses due to incomplete context
- Limits AI usage for tasks requiring broad codebase awareness

### Goals
- Get accurate, architecture-aware answers from Claude
- Reduce time spent on context preparation
- Stop hitting context window limits
- Have Claude understand their entire project, not just isolated files

### Behaviors
- Power user of keyboard shortcuts
- Values efficiency over hand-holding
- Willing to learn new tools that save time
- Skeptical of "magic" solutions—wants to understand how things work
