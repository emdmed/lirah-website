Primary User Persona: “The Agent Power User”
Name

Alex Morgan (placeholder — neutral, realistic)

Demographics

Age: 28–35

Location: US (SF, NYC, Austin, Seattle, remote-first)

Role: Senior Frontend Engineer / Full-Stack Engineer / AI-Curious Engineer

Experience: 6–10 years professional development

Company Type: Startup or scale-up (10–300 people)

Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, Node, modern tooling

Environment: macOS or Linux, terminal-heavy workflow

Professional Context

Alex ships features fast and is judged on output, speed, and reliability, not experimentation for its own sake.

They:

Use CLI agents (Claude Code, opencode) daily

Run agents multiple times per task

Work on large, evolving codebases

Care deeply about signal vs noise in tooling

AI is not a novelty — it’s infrastructure.

Goals

Get better results from agents with less effort

Reduce wasted tokens and prompt bloat

Run agents longer without blowing through usage limits

Keep context explicit, minimal, and intentional

Stay in flow — never fight the tool

“I want my agent to know exactly what I mean, without me babysitting it.”

Core Pain Points (Problem-Aware)

Bloated prompts and accidental context overload

Copy-pasting file paths and instructions into terminals

Agents hallucinating because they “kind of” saw a file

Large files destroying context windows

Burning money on tokens for irrelevant scaffolding

Context management becoming manual, fragile, and tiring

“I spend more time setting up the agent than using it.”

Existing Workarounds (Before Lirah)

Manually curating file lists in prompts

Re-running agents with tweaked instructions

Splitting tasks unnaturally to avoid context overflow

Trusting the agent blindly and fixing fallout later

Writing ad-hoc prompt templates in notes or gists

These work — but don’t scale.

Why Lirah Resonates

Lirah clicks because it:

Treats context as a first-class primitive

Makes intent explicit (modify / reference / example)

Enforces token discipline without slowing flow

Feels like a real dev tool, not a demo UI

Fits directly into existing CLI workflows

“This doesn’t try to replace my agent — it makes it better.”

Key Value Triggers

Token savings that are immediately visible

Smart file slicing instead of naive full-file dumps

Familiar terminal-first UX

Works with any CLI agent (no lock-in)

Saves both time and money without ceremony

Buying / Adoption Signals

Already paying for Claude Pro / Team

Talking about “context windows” unironically

Running agents “all day”

Complains about prompt bloat on Twitter / Discord

Actively testing multiple agent setups

Objections & Hesitations

“Will this slow me down?”

“Is this just another wrapper?”

“Does it get in the way of the terminal?”

“Is the token optimization actually smart or just marketing?”

Lirah overcomes this by:

Being fast, native, and transparent

Letting Alex stay in control at all times

Showing value within the first few runs

One-Line Persona Summary

A senior startup engineer who uses CLI agents daily and wants tighter context, lower token burn, and better results — without sacrificing speed or control.
