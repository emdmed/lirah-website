# Lirah Marketing Copy

## Project Compact

### Tagline Options

**Primary:**
"Give Claude your entire codebase in a single prompt."

**Alternatives:**
- "Your whole project. A fraction of the tokens."
- "Full codebase context. Minimal token cost."
- "See the forest and the trees—without burning your context window."

### Hero Copy

**One-Click Codebase Intelligence**

Stop cherry-picking files. Stop explaining your architecture. With Project Compact, Claude sees your entire project structure—every function signature, every class definition, every module boundary—compressed into a token-efficient overview.

One shortcut. Full context. Smarter answers.

---

### Feature Breakdown

**What it does:**
Project Compact parses your entire codebase and extracts a structural skeleton—function names, parameters, class hierarchies, and module exports—without the implementation details that bloat your context window.

**The result:**
- A 50,000-line codebase → ~5K tokens
- Claude understands where things live, what they do, and how they connect
- No more "which file handles authentication?" back-and-forth

### Key Benefits

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Manually selecting relevant files | One-click full project context |
| Guessing what Claude needs to know | Claude sees everything |
| Burning 100K+ tokens on raw files | 70-90% token compression |
| "I don't have access to that file" | "Based on your project structure..." |

### How It Works

1. **Scan** — Automatically discovers all JS/TS/Python files, skipping node_modules, dist, and other noise
2. **Parse** — Extracts function signatures, class definitions, imports, and exports using AST analysis
3. **Compress** — Formats everything into a clean, readable structural overview
4. **Confirm** — Shows you the token savings before adding to your prompt

### Long-form Copy (landing page section)

**Stop Explaining Your Codebase**

Every developer knows the pain: you ask Claude a question, and it doesn't know about that utility function in utils/helpers.js, or the type definitions in types/api.ts, or how your components are organized.

So you start copying files. Then more files. Then you hit the context limit.

Project Compact changes everything.

With a single keyboard shortcut, Lirah parses your entire project and extracts a structural skeleton—the shape of your code without the implementation details. Function signatures. Class hierarchies. Module exports. Everything Claude needs to understand your architecture, compressed to a fraction of the original size.

A 50,000-line TypeScript project? About 5,000 tokens. A sprawling Python monorepo? Claude can hold the whole thing in context.

No more file-by-file selection. No more "which files are relevant?" decisions. Just press Ctrl+Shift+P, confirm the compression stats, and ask your question with full project awareness.

Your codebase. Claude's context. Finally in sync.

### Comparison Hook

**Without Project Compact:** "Let me check... which files should I share? Is 12 files enough context? Did I miss the type definitions?"

**With Project Compact:** "Here's my whole project. Where should I add the new API endpoint?"
