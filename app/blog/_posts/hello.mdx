# Hey, welcome to the Lirah blog

Sup, I'm Lirah's dev and I'll be writing some technical and product articles here.

Expect posts about how Lirah works under the hood, the problems it solves, and the decisions behind its design. Nothing too formal — just sharing what I'm building and why.

Stay tuned.
